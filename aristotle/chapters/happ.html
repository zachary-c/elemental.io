	<h1> Chapter 3: Happiness</h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<p> What is happiness? Is it pleasure? Having all you could ever want and not needing anything? No, that’s the life of fatted cattle. Is it wealth and money? No, but what one does with wealth is a test of character - if you are virtuous being wealthy is a good thing but it doesn’t lead to true happiness or virtue of its own. Is it honor? Honor is others holding you in good regard. However, honor includes a sort of paradox - It is honorable to do honorable things without seeking the honor from them. For example, if I go out of my way to make someone’s life easier but I do it because I want to people to think I’m a good person and not because I actually care, then I don’t have honor. On the other hand, if I just have that person’s best interests in mind and want to be kind to them, then I do have honor.
		</p> <p>
		So, what is happiness? Well, if it’s not honor and honor is a very high goal, than whatever it is must be even higher. To explore what that is, first a critical thing to understand is that to say a thing is good is the same thing as saying it has the being of a particular thing. Going back to the example earlier, a good cup has the being of a cup (i.e., it holds liquid). But the cup is something made by somebody else. The good of animals (fulfilling their goals in life) primarily has to do with genetic gifts and following instincts. But humans are more than that. Human beings being good depends on choice and formation of a virtuous character. That in and of itself shows our uniqueness.
		</p> <p>
		Thus, happiness has to be essentially human. So, from <a href="nature.html">Chapter 2</a>, speech and reason are essentially human qualities, so it must draw from that. But there also has to be something in the soul that is persuaded by these two. That would be virtues.
		</p> <p>
		Aristotle defines happiness as a, “certain sort of being at work of the soul in accordance with virtue.” Virtues are active-conditions of the soul. An active condition (see below) is a stable and constant attitude towards something. Being at-work is when the virtues (as active conditions) are fully engaged. So, happiness can be summarized as virtues working in accordance with excellence towards all the ways a human being thinks and acts.
