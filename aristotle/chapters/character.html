		<p> Character - here we are. Character is born out of choices. There are two types of virtues - excellence of thinking (intellectual virtue) and of character (moral virtue). The first is from teaching, and the second is from habit. The Greek words for habit and character are ethos (habit) and êthos (character), which is a small inflection but they are very different. Character involves intentional choices, whereas habit often does not. Habit gradually forms into character by making choices.
		</p> <p>
		Virtues of character are not of nature nor contrary to nature - they appear “in us who are of such a nature to take them on.”  By nature, for example would be a river flowing. Contrary to nature would be that river flowing up into the sky instead of staying on the ground. Character is effortful choices made to fulfill our nature, and this is an aspect of human freedom.
		</p> <p>
		Each of these virtues are a mean between two extremes. Courage, for instance, is in between rashness and cowardice. You must have the proper amount of fear to truly be courageous. This virtuous mean is not a hard and fast ruling - it is determined by education and experience in the area. When deciding what to do in a situation, almost everyone knows what is right to do - southerners knew slavery was wrong, the accused at the Nuremberg trials didn’t say they thought they were doing the right thing.
		</p> <p>
		Lastly, there are four conditions of the soul - Virtuous, Continent, Incontinent, and Vicious. I’ll start with the middle two: Continent means you are pulled to do the wrong thing but resists and do what is right, and Incontinent means the opposite - you are pulled to do the right thing but fail and do what is wrong. Viciousness is a stable, active condition (see Ch. 3 definitions) in which you are committed to doing bad. Virtue, on the other hand, is when you choose what is right and take pleasure in it for its own sake. This is an honorable position, and people give you honor because that’s the only thing they can give you - you’re satisfied and don’t need anything else.
