	<h1> Westward Expansion </h1>

		<h3><b>The Land</b></h3>
		<p>
		The “great fact” of the land in the west is something written about at length by the author Willa Cather. She was a turn-of-the-century progressive writer who explored life on the plains and how the United States moved west. She described going west as our Odyssey - our defining moment of can we claim the continent. Overwhelmed by the Rocky Mountains and the enormity of the landscape itself, settlers built towns and communities across the frontier.

		One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post office. <br><br></i>O Pioneers!<i> Willa Cather, 1913, pg. 1</i>

		Brad Birzer, the lecturer for this unit of the course, emphasizes Cather’s description of the frontier as an open and wild place, and especially the little town “trying not to be blown away.” To Professor Birzer, this is one of the best depictions of the American West.

		<h3>Lewis and Clark</h3>
		<p>
		Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out from St. Louis on May 14, 1804, with 44-55 men, plus Sacagewea (my sources are unclear). The Corps of Discovery, as it was known, had been commissioned by President Jefferson to explore the territory all the way to the Pacific Ocean. They took tons of books with them, and every spare moment the men had was spent writing, documenting, recording and describing the land and life around them. They identified hundreds of new species and plants, as well as initiating peaceful relations with many Native American tribes.
		</p><p>
		The party itself was equal - Lewis and Clark were in charge, but the group voted as equals, including Sacagewea and York. York was Clark’s slave he took with them, but over the course of the journey was freed by Clark and came home a free man. There was only one casualty on the entire trip, despite harsh conditions, and that was when shortly after having left St. Louis, a man’s appendix exploded. Not a lot they could do about that, and he died, unfortunately.
		</p> <p>
		The Corps’ mission was a great scientific journey, not unlike the Moonshot, 150 years later. They finally reached the Pacific Ocean in November of 1805, with Clark famously recording in his journal,
		</p> <p>
		<i>"Ocian in view! O! the joy."</i>
		</p> <p>
		They began the trip home once the winter had passed. On September 23, 1806, the Corps reached St. Louis. They were met with a fantastic reception, being lost men brought back to life after their journey. Lewis was made Governor of the Louisiana Territory, and Clark was made Brigadier General of Militia for the Louisiana Territory and a federal Indian agent. They were both awarded large swathes of land for their efforts, and their maps and charts allowed for easier exploration of the West.

		<h3>Northwest Ordinance</h3>
		<p>
		There were four primary documents, called the Organic Laws, that laid out the foundation of government in the United States. These were:
		</p> 
		<p class="lsit">1. Declaration of Independence, 1776
		<br>2. Articles of Confederation, 1781
		<br>3. Northwest Ordinance, 1787
		<br>4. Constitution of the United States, 1789</p>
		<p>
		These lay out the purpose of the government, and how the country is to be run. The Northwest Ordinance is probably the least known of these four documents, and has less impact today as it was practically the ‘mission statement’ of the west. It laid out what to do with the massive Northwest Territory, a huge portion of land given to the United States by Great Britain in 1783. 
		</p> 
		<div class="imgcontainer"> <img src="../imgs/northwest_territory.gif" alt="map of northwest territory"></div>
		<p>
		The Northwest Ordinance consists of 14 sections which state how the territory should be handled until they can become states, and six articles that decree certain facts about the law in the territory (I will be paraphrasing/summarizing all of these; if you would like to read the entire thing for yourself, link will be below).
		</p> <p>
		Article 1. No one can be persecuted for any religion they choose to worship. (this lays out more clear religious freedom, rather than simply not having a state religion)
		</p> <p>
		Article 2. Lays out British Common law, the right to trial by peers, representation in the legislature, burden of proof on the state - all the old and understood English rights are transferred into this new territory. Additionally, Article 2 of the Northwest Ordinance contains the most explicit protection of private, civil agreements. No law will be made or take effect that interferes with private contracts or engagements, as long as they are without fraud.
		</p> <p>
		Article 3. Religious and Civil Liberty of Association is laid out here, protecting and encouraging schools, morality, and knowledge. Additionally, Article 3 lays out the equality of the Indian and states “...utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent;”
		</p> <p>
		Article 4. Has to do with how the the territory remains a part of the Articles of Confederation and how they are to be taxed under the US Government.
		</p> <p>
		Article 5. States how the territory is to be divided; no more than five and no fewer than three states should be made out of it; it also says how those states are to be bordered.
		</p> <p>
		Article 6. Slavery/involuntary servitude is not allowed in the territory. It does allow for escaped slaves found in the territory to be returned to their owners.
		</p> <p>
		These Articles, 1-3 and 6 especially, lay out the idealist view of America - what is strived for and what was not originally embraced in the states. Here, as well, is perhaps the greatest proof that the founders wanted slavery to end. They outlawed it in the new territories, but were waiting for the union to be stronger before attempting to remove it from the states themselves.
		</p> <p>
		In order for the West to function, people have to willingly go out there. People, if they will be enslaved in the west, will not go out there. It’s impossible to imagine a West that held onto slavery - if anyone was going to put in the effort, they had to be free.
