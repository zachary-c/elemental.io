	<h1> The Nature of Man</h1>

		<hr>
		<p> Politics are necessary for virtue, because a city is necessary for virtue. But before we can talk about that, we have to explain a city. </p>
		<p>First, the family. The family consists of male and female and is the most foundational unit of community. It provides for the daily needs of humans, and is the male and female together because you need them to make more males and females; to reproduce humans. But you also need more than just a family because: the young need defense, it is hard to have any real trade amongst a small familial group, and you need more families for the kids to be able to make their own families. So, we have the village, and then the city.
		</p> <p>
		The village consists of a group of families working together to trade, provide a defense against other groups of humans/natural occurrences, and create more families. This results in groups of villages, in the city. The city is the highest and most authoritative community and its goal is to live well. The city is self-sufficient, enforces law, and exists for the sake of living well and establishing virtue.
		</p> <p>
		Now, why are humans so political and so communal? The nature to be communal animals is embedded in all humans far more than other animals - even herd animals like cattle or hive minds of bees are not as reliant on each other as humans are. Thus, the political side of everyone is embedded through logos, the Greek word for reason and speech. Humans can talk to each other and that speech allows us to perceive and deliberate about what is just and unjust, good and bad.
		</p> <p>
		Language with our speech derives from our ability to understand common nouns. If I say, “Go find a pen in my office,” even though the pens in there may look completely different from any you have seen, you’ll still be able to find it. Same thing with a cup, or a book. The details vary greatly but you can still understand what it is. This allows us to understand each other.
		</p> <p>
		As we said in the last chapter, a good cup is one that fulfills its purpose; or holds liquid. A person who is good is linked to the unique human capacity for speech and reason and requires the practice of moral virtues and building of good character.
