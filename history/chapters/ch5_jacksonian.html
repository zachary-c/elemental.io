	<h1> Jacksonian Democracy </h1>

		<h3><b>The Period</b></h3>
		<p>
		1807-1848 - the period after the founding generation. It’s a difficult period for those who lived and grew up in it, the sons of founding fathers especially. There isn’t a way for them to live up to the sacrifices the generation before them made. Figures like Edwin Stanton, Frederick Douglass, Noah Webster, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson shaped this period, all eccentric and a little bit different.
		</p> <p>
		This period had great advances in technology as well - the steam ship, the steam engine, railroads and telegrams in 1844. Westward expansion and the advent of these technologies aid each other - you want more people to go west, so you build a railroad, more people want to go west, you build more railroad, even more people now want to go west, etc. It was a feedback loop that rapidly moved the population from near the east to all the way out to the edges of Missouri and Kansas.
		</p> <p>
		Additionally, there’s a sort of second Great Awakening happening here - people are believing in very immediate spiritual relationships with God - no intermediaries through churches. There’s an evangelical fervor as well, inspiring radical individualism of being your own man and building yourself up.
		</p> <p>
		Henry David Thoreau had some opinions during this time. He was an incredibly radical abolitionist for the time, and he was not at all a fan of government. He published an essay titled Civil Disobedience, which argued for protesting unjust laws. This later inspired other peaceful protestors such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. His entire idea was, “That government is best which governs not at all; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.” He also spent a night in jail for refusing to pay taxes, protesting slavery and the Mexican War.
		</p><p>
		Mention of the Mexican War brings us to another fact about this period. There isn’t a defining war. In the founding period, there’s the American Revolution. The decades after this there’s the Civil War. Then about 50 years after that, there’s the first World War. Then the second World War. Then the Cold War begins, and the Korean, Vietnam, and wars in the Middle East carry through up to today. But the period of 1807-1848 doesn’t have a defining war, and the wars in it are kind of strange. There’s the War of 1812, which was short lived and didn’t change anything territorially. There’s the Mexican War, which was opposed by many Americans and just kind of weird.
		</p> <p>
		This period saw astounding population growth - on average, women had 13 children. Thomas Jefferson said it would take 1000 years to populate St. Louis; instead, it took 10. There had been five great migrations prior to the revolutionary war - West African slaves (unfree migration), the Scot-Irish, Quakers, Puritans, and Anglicans. This population boom is from all five groups multiplying at an inordinate rate. Additionally, between 1801 and 1924 if you showed up on American soil and didn’t have a criminal record (international criminal records were sketchy at the time, so this one likely wouldn’t matter) or tuberculosis you could be made an American citizen that day.
		</p> <p>
		Lastly, why is it called the Jacksonian Period? Primarily because historians wanted a strong democratic model of a president attached to the time frame. He was a legitimate war hero, and established the presidency as an embodiment of the people. That trend has since been adopted by nearly every president.
		</p>
		
		<h3><b>Tocqueville</b></h3>
		<p> 
		Alexis de Tocqueville also had some opinions. And Hillsdale college is a big fan of these opinions. He was a French, Roman Catholic Aristocrat who came over to America in 1830, 31, and 32 to explore the country. America is not big fan of the French, Aristocrats, or Roman Catholics. Nonetheless, he got got to meet the last signer of the declaration of independence, and he gave a quite accurate depiction of America’s democratic character.
		</p> <p>
		He said there’s a fundamental problem with being enamored with equality - it’s a free society with an inequality of talents. We can either become jealous or encouraging of things other people are good at - in one case, we tear everyone down ot the lowest common denominator, or we have an equality of excellence. In the latter situation, we build up those around us and are all great at our own specific things rather than making every equally bad at everything. Tocqueville isn’t sure in his writings which path America will take - he leaves that to the future to determine.
		</p> <p>
		Something else Tocqueville observes is that Americans create clubs like nobody’s business. Americans love to get together and found seminaries, schools, churches, jails, associations - everything. Americans love building social institutions. It’s a self-help method of dealing with social problems, and it builds good communities. But Tocqueville warns that the moment we lose that drive to help each other and help our communities, the government will step in in a heavy handed way. Government knows no nuance in laying down rules - they have to have a blanket effect and cannot be tailored the same way a community can handle issues. Once government has stepped into a space, it’s very difficult to disentangle it.
