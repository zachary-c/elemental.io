	<h1> Chapter 7: Justice </h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<p> Justice is the most public virtue - it has the most to do with others. Justice is giving what is owed, not only to oneself but to others as well. Comprehensive justice consists of three parts - religion, politics, and friendship. Religion is giving to God what we owe - service and praise. Politics is giving to the city what we owe - allegiance, protection, and respect. Friendship is giving to our friends what we owe - what is best for them - they are a friend. In order to fulfill justice completely, we require all the other virtues as well - courage, moderation, generosity, etc.
		</p> <p>
		That’s justice in an encompassing, complete sense. In a simpler sense, justice is concerned with restoration. If someone commits a crime, say steals someone’s money, then a court of justice is concerned with figuring out who committed the crime and getting the money back. But that process is messy and can go poorly. One would not call justice in that form beautiful. But it is necessary for giving what is owed to the wronged person.
		</p> <p>
		Punishing someone acting unjustly is very important, because a wrong act causes the whole community to suffer. Dr. Arnn gives the example of Hillsdale college and people not stealing other people’s stuff. It’s not locked. It’s out in the open. Backpacks sometimes contain valuable equipment - Macbooks and other things. But everybody agrees that if people just took whatever they liked it would be bad for the community. So everyone agrees to not steal stuff. You are giving up a narrow desire for the greater good.
		</p> <p>
		Laws are important for enforcing justice. But if everyone was virtuous, there would be no need for laws because nobody would break them. But how do you get a just society without good laws? You can’t. You need the laws to train people to act in a just way.
		</p> <p>
		Lastly, punishing someone may not seem like a good act. Putting someone in prison for the rest of their life doesn’t seem good. But if one brings in the context - murder, or another evil crime - then it is just to do this seemingly wrong act. Evil corrupts one’s character, and it is for the person’s own benefit (they are giving what is owed to the person they wronged) to shape their character in a good way.
