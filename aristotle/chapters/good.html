	<h1> Chapter 1: The Good</h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<p>The purpose of ethics is to become good. What is good? That’s the other question. We call things good when they are fully what they are. For example, a good glass holds liquid. A good pencil writes and erases. If a glass stops holding liquid and leaks, we wouldn’t call it a good glass anymore. Simple enough. But then the problem arises of acts like murder. Is a successful murder a good murder? What about if it’s a successful murdering of Hitler? A good murder would be one that is fully what it is, so a successful one would indeed (by this definition) be a good murder.
		</p> <p>
		What about a good person? Well, for that we need to take a step back and talk about something else first. What does each thing serve? Aristotle speaks of bridle-making. What’s a bridle for? To be able to ride a horse. What’s the purpose of riding a horse? In Aristotle’s day, making a force of calvary for war. What is the purpose of war? Victory, which serves in turn the higher purpose of happiness. Happiness is the ultimate good in life, and is thus at the top. Each thing on this chain lends dignity to the thing below it. Thus, making a bridle is a dignified goal as it contributes ultimately to happiness. This idea of a hierarchy of good means that there are higher goods for which one can aim. 
		</p> <p>
		So how does all of that relate to a good person? Good people are the subject of chapters 3-10, but as a foundation for that, it clarifies what it means to live a good life. A person’s goodness is characterized (no pun intended) by their character. We’ll discuss character more in <a href="character.html">Chapter 4</a>, but for now all one needs to know is that character results from actions that etch marks on your soul. It sounds very highfalutin but it will make more sense later. Character leads to how you act and what goals you aim for. Happiness is the highest good, and is pursued for its own sake. <br>
