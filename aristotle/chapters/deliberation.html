	<h1> Chapter 5: Deliberation and Choice</h1>
	<div>

		<p> To begin, there are willing and unwilling actions, which are pretty much what they sound like. Willing actions have the source of one who is acting themselves and know the circumstances, and unwilling actions are the result of compulsion. The differentiation here shows that hard choices are not often made in a totally pure decision-making process. Hard choices typically involve duress - the temptation of pleasure or risk of losing something. 
		</p> <p>
		Deliberation is the process by which humans choose the right course of action to reach a specific end. Choices in and of themselves are complex and unclear much of the time, and thus human beings must be skilled at deliberating in various situations with various means. Human beings are rational, and this allows us to define our desires through deliberation. Then we can make rational choices towards those desires.
		</p> <p>
		The problem arises in that we often don’t have enough time or information to make the best choice. Choices made under stress look more like a guessing game than a thought-out process, and since choices lead to actions actions are not always the best performed or thought-out.
		</p> <p>
		Lastly, what do we deliberate about? A better question is what we don’t deliberate about. One doesn’t ponder unchanging things, things that are beyond human control, and simplistic ideas of perception (identifying a chair, for example). Those things we can’t do anything about, and thus it doesn’t if I think we should blow up the sun - there’s no practical way to do that anyways. What we do deliberate about are things that are up to us and are matters of action. But if we do something and it works out well we still often question the motives behind it. This goes to show that motivations are more important than actions for the purposes of defining character.
