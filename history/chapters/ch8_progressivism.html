		<h3><b>First Wave</b></h3>
		<p>
		In the late 1800s, people, especially small farmers, are upset. The railroad companies, massive corporations, are charging them more than large companies, and they’re being charged more for shorter hauls. The Interstate Commerce Act is proposed and eventually ratified in 1887. It declares that Congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states. The ICA created the ICC, the Interstate Commerce Commission, designed to both adjudicate individual cases and create regulations. Congresspeople didn’t know enough about the industry to be able to properly regulate it, so they left it up to “experts” (As the course states, the experts were not so much experts as unelected bureaucrats).
		</p> <p>
		Theodore Roosevelt comes on the scene as one of the first major progressive presidents. He set in place many things presidents after him adopted - the idea of being a bold public figure that is a “steward of the people,” for one. He expanded executive power and with great charisma created the now-common “image of the presidency.” He ran as a progressive in the Republican Party, which at the time was the progressive party. He succeeded William Mckinley after the latter’s assassination in 1901, and then won a second term in 1904. At one point during his presidency, during coal strikes in Pennsylvania, TR threatened to send in 10,000 US troops to get the coal production back on track. When he was warned by an aide that this would be entirely unconstitutional, he exclaimed, “To hell with the Constitution when the people want coal!”
		</p> <p>
		Roosevelt stepped down after his second term, but, when his successor William Howard Taft was not progressive enough, he jumped back into the political scene. In 1912 he ran with the newly-formed Bull Moose Party, and split the vote enough for Woodrow Wilson to claim the Presidency. 
		</p> <p>
		Wilson’s philosophy was that the constitutional governmental limits were fine for the late 1700s when the constitution was created, but they would not work in a modern state. He argued that the government constantly fighting itself made it impossible to properly deal with the modern issues facing the country. The urban and industrial revolution needed to be handled differently, so there needed to be a modern state not unlike the Europeans. This cuts completely against the idea of American Exceptionalism, which is that we are not like any European country or any other country for that matter - we are totally different in how we run our country and we should keep it that way.
		</p><p>
		Wilson ran much more conservatively than he governed, creating the Federal Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission, both of which regulated the economy. In 1919 he instituted a modest income tax, which has been growing ever since. During World War 1, he practically imposed socialism. He instituted prohibition before the 18th amendment was ratified, as well as controlling the press and the distribution of goods. Woodrow Wilson was crazy, but he wasn’t able to push things all the way. The controls he put in place were dismantled after the war, and in 1920 the motto became to continue the progressive actions but not increase or decrease them further.
		</p> 
		<h3> <b>Second Wave</b> </h3>
		<p>
		The second wave of Progressivism was centered on one man - FDR. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was much more careful than Wilson. He spoke like the founders did - discussing things like his “2nd Bill of Rights.” These included the right to a useful job, to earn enough to make a living, to good health, protection from age and illness, to a good education, and so on and so forth. All of these things are good and often a part of the American dream, but they are not rights guaranteed under US law. FDR also began changing the meaning of words in subtle ways - the right to pursue education, for example. Under the constitution, everyone has the right to pursue an education, but FDR talked about the right to education. The removal of the “pursue” makes it an entitlement - someone else has to provide you with that education.
		</p> <p>
		FDR’s New Deal and his attempts to expand it after the fact called for creating cartels out of industries, creating farming conglomerations, implementing social security, and giving money to states directly for the pursuit of healthcare. A lot of his plans kept getting struck down by the courts, however, so he began threatening to pack the Supreme Court. To anyone unfamiliar with this term, it’s the idea of increasing the number of judges on the Supreme Court so you can appoint more from your side. There are nine justices currently, and have been since 1869. In 1937, FDR attempted to convince Congress to increase the number of judges to 15, meaning he would be able to appoint judges friendly to his plans. Fortunately, a bipartisan Congress and everybody else including the current Supreme Court (which was atypically public in its opposition) did not go for his plan.
		</p> 
		<p>
		Nonetheless, in 1937, he made his first appointment due to Justice Willis Van Devanter retiring. By 1941, he had appointed seven justices and the court had gotten out of his way. They moved to focusing on civil and individual rather than economic or business rights.
		</p> <p>
		This allowed FDR to implement many of his plans which are still in effect, in some form, today. The New Deal was probably the largest Progressive leap in the countries history, although it has kept growing. Since then, Lyndon B. Johnson expanded Progressivism further with the 3rd wave and his Great Society. <i>(This wasn’t discussed much in the course, so maybe I’ll do some research later and come back to this one after the project is done)</i>
		</p> <p>
		The most recent wave of Progressivism, arguably, is the Obama Coalition. Whether this is a true wave of progressivism in the same sense as the others is still to be decided. The problem with discussing recent history is the history is still being written - we don’t know how it’s going to turn out yet.
