	<h1> Crisis of the Union </h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<h3><b>The Climate</b></h3>
		<p>
		When the founders established the constitution, they planned for it to end. As Roger Taney in 1820 put it, the problem of slavery was that they had the wolf by the ears. It was unjust to take it up and unsafe to let it go. The founders adopted a compromise that would contain slavery and allow the trade to continue for twenty years before any ban was placed upon it:
		</p> <p> <i>
		“The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.” <br><br>Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1</i>
		</p> <p>
		This statement in the Constitution appeased the Southern States (especially South Carolina) enough for them to join the union. The idea was that eventually it would end and it looked like it would, on its own, as the inability to grow and harvest cotton inland made it an uneconomical path. However, in 1794 Eli Whitney changed all of that.
		</p> <p>
		At the time, the best place cotton could be grown was along the coastline, a type known as long-staple cotton. Inland, if you wanted to grow cotton, you had to grow the short-staple variant, which took much longer to clean and harvest than long-staple. The founders assumed that the eastern states would be the only ones who held slaves as it would become financially unviable to grow short-staple inland for the cost. Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin allowed for much greater production and growing of cotton all along the southern part of the United States, requiring far more slaves to work the crops. The trade of African slaves boomed until 1808, when, as intended, Congress voted to ban the slave trade. By now there were some four million slaves in the South, forming a self-sustaining population. Any new children born to them were automatically made slaves as well.
		</p><p>
		In Haiti, in 1791, there was a black slave revolt. The entire island of Haiti ended up throwing off its chains and becoming a country by 1804. This created a lot of concern from other countries, attempting to suppress the news of the successful black revolution from their own slave population. They ostracised the economically destitute country, which meant that half of America wanted to trade with them and half of it didn’t. The southern states were terrified of a four-million man uprising and the damage it would do, and the northern states hoped to encourage and establish friendly relations with the little country.
		</p> <p>
		The last piece of the cultural climate is the religious perspective. Northern Christianity took a mainstream stance that slavery was evil, which led to a wave of evangelical abolitionists. The Southern Christians sort of apologized for it but a wide gap in beliefs opened up.
		</p> <p>
		Now, the political scene. There’s something called the Northwest Ordinance that’s been in place since 1787. It allows new states to the west to join the union. In 1820, Missouri wants to do just that. But at the time there are 11 free states and 11 slave states - adding a new state could upset that balance and throw Congress into turmoil. So Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky proposed a compromise - we’ll let Missouri in as a slave state and Maine will join as a free state. 12-12. The other part of this legislation is they declared slavery would be illegal in any states north of the 36° 30’ parrellel (that’s the southern edge of Missouri; Missouri would be an exception). Hooray! The Union is saved.
		</p> <p>
		Then the Mexican war happens. The northerners are suddenly very concerned because we just got a whole bunch of land from Mexico and all of it is below that dividing line. But none of those are states yet, so we’ll keep adding in states two at a time and hope that works out when we get there.
		</p> <p>
		<h3> <i>The Compromise of 1850</i> </h3>
		In 1850, California (part of the Mexican Territories) has had a gold rush and had enough people to join the Union. They want to join as a free state, but that would throw off the balance of pro-slavery and anti-slavery states. The tensions over what to do with the Mexican Territories (called the Mexican Cession), a huge portion of land acquired in the Mexican War, were building rapidly. The Northerners were upset as they worried the 36° 30’ line would result in a lot of new slave states, and the Southerners were upset because if California was admitted as a free state, that would throw off the balance of states. Also, Texas, which is kind of its own unit, is claiming that all of the territory received in the Mexican Cession belongs to them, which nobody but Texas likes. So Henry Clay has another compromise.
		</p> 
		<p> a) California is admitted as the 16th free state.</p>
		<p> b) The south is guaranteed that no restrictions on slavery will be placed in the new Utah or New Mexico Territories.</p>
		<p> c) Texas loses its claims and its borders are established as what they are today, but the federal government will assume $10 million dollars of their debt.</p>
		<p> d) The new Fugitive Slave Act is passed, a brutal law that requires northerners to return runaway slaves.</p>
		<p>
		The two most key points of this compromise are California being admitted and the Fugitive Slave Act. California’s presence in the Senate meant that the balance was now with the free states, although they voted with the south on some issues in the 1850s. But the Fugitive Slave Act was the most controversial part of this compromise by far. It made the punishments for assisting an escaping slave much harsher, and it also denied them a right to jury trial.
		</p> <p>
		So if a black man was suspected of being a slave, he would be dragged before a judge, asked if the judge thought he was a slave, and then based off that judge’s decision then and there he would be either set free or sent south to the slave states. This applied everywhere, but there was immediate outcry. Vermont and Wisconsin passed measures intended to nullify it, and the Underground Railroad reached its peak, with many slaves and non-slaves alike fleeing to Canada to escape the unjust law. It was widely unenforced in the North, but it increased the temperature in the room and resulted in riots and revolts in the North.
		</p> <p>
		The union held together, for a time, until the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. This act, proposed by Stephen Douglas, is practically what set the country on fire. But before we can discuss that, let's take a step forward in time to talk about the Dred Scott Supreme Court Decision and Stephen Douglas’s political views.</p>

		<h3><b>Dred Scott Court Case</b></h3>
		<p> 
		Dred Scott was a slave who had been owned by several masters and lived in St. Louis as well as several other free states with his wife, Harriet. The two of them, after having lived in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa, as well as St. Louis for a considerable time, filed lawsuits for freedom in 1846. They had lived in free territory and thus should be free, based off Missouri statutes. Since Wisconsin and Illinois were both free states, they had a compelling case. A series of judges ruled in favor or against them as the case made its way up the chain to the Supreme Court, where it was watched closely as a potentially landmark case.
		</p> <p>
		The decision, made by Roger Taney (best known for this case), was that all people of African descent, free or slave, were not US citizens and thus had no rights in a federal court. In addition, he declared that the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had created the line dividing slave and free states, was unconstitutional in the first place (despite its being repealed by the Kansas-Nebraska Act). In essence, this meant that Congress had no right or power to limit the spread of slavery in any way.
		</p> <p>
		This case was a bombshell to abolitionists, and if the temperature in the room was high before it was boiling now. People were mad. People were upset. The South saw it as a victory, but the North saw it as the Supreme Court ruling that slavery could be made legal everywhere. If a slave who had lived in the North for years was not free, who could be made free?
		</p>
		<h3><b>Lincoln-Douglas Debates</b></h3>
		<p> 
		Now we come to the Lincoln-Douglas debates. In 1858 Abraham Lincoln would run to challenge Stephen Douglas for his seat as a senator from Illinois. The seven debates between them laid out both of their political views, and are considered to be some of the most important debates in US History. Lincoln’s point of view was entirely that “a house divided against itself cannot stand.”
		</p> <p> <i>
		"I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."</i>
		</p> <p> 
		Lincoln argued that the founders intended that certain inalienable rights laid out in the constitution applied to all men, black and white, whereas Douglas argued that the founders only intended government to be run by white people. Douglas was personally opposed to slavery, but he was a proponent of the idea of popular sovereignty - states should be able to decide for themselves.
		</p> <p> <i>
		“...if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill.”</i>
		</p> <p>
		Douglas, as the sitting senator, ultimately retained his seat, but Lincoln became a powerful figure as a result of his manner during these speeches. He was a moderate but unwilling to compromise on slavery, and this set him up as a powerful figure of the Republican party, as well as the 1860 presidential candidate.
		</p>
		<h3><b>Kansas-Nebraska Act</b></h3>
		<p>
		Now back to 1854, where Stephen Douglas made everybody so mad. Kansas wants to join the union, but once again, will it be a free state or a slave state? Stephen Douglas, with his idea of popular sovereignty, orchestrated the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise. It allowed each state to decide for itself whether or not it wanted to be slave or free, removing the 36° 30’ parallel line that had kept the northern states free and the southern states slave. Removal of this meant that Kansas, above the line, could now become a slave state - it just depended on what the residents there voted for.
		</p> <p>
		Pro- and anti- slavery supporters flooded into Kansas, hoping to vote to declare the state for their side. This resulted in Bleeding Kansas, a period in which riots and violence broke out all across the state. There was an election held by the pro-slavery supporters which declared it to be a slave states. They were accused of election fraud, so an anti-slavery election was held, but the pro-slavery settlers refused to vote. Two opposing legislatures were established, neither of which could really do anything. Franklin Pierce, the president at the time, sent in federal troops to calm things down and remove one of the legislatures. Another election was called and the pro-slavery settlers won, before once again being accused of election fraud.
		</p> <p>
		As a result, Kansas’ constitution was not recognized by Congress. It was not allowed to become a state until it was admitted as a free state in 1861, just before the start of the Civil War.
		</p> <p>
		The other important aspect of the Kansas-Nebraska Act was how it effectively created the Republican Party. It grew out of anger over Douglas’ bill, and it felt the Whig party was not strong enough to combat the crisis of slavery. This of course is the party that nominated and ran Abraham Lincoln all the way to the presidency. So in a way, if it weren’t for Stephen Douglas in multiple ways, through the Kansas-Nebraska Act and their debates, Abraham Lincoln might never have become president.
		</p> <p>
		All of this sets the stage for the Civil War, which would break out almost as soon as Lincoln took office. The Civil War is the bloodiest war in American history, with 620,000 estimated dead from fighting, disease, or starvation. There have been a total of 1,264,000 American losses throughout its history of wars - 620,000 in the Civil War and 644,000 in all the others. The country would recover, but it would not be easy.
