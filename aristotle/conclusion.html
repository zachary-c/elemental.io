		In conclusion, a good life comes via happiness. From <a href="happ.html">Chapter 3</a>, happiness is virtues working together well towards all the ways a human being thinks and acts. Think about it - it feels good and fulfilling to behave in a right way. Thus, happiness.
		</p> <p> 
		The goal of this is how to lead a good life (<a href="good.html">Chapter 1</a>). Happiness is that good. Good meaning a thing being fully what its purpose is means that a good human life means you live according to a human purpose. That purpose is quantified in <a href="nature.html">Chapter 2</a> - humans live in community and are uniquely able to communicate. To communicate well, one must practice moral virtues and the building of character.
		</p> <p>
		<a href="character.html">Chapter 4</a> deals with character - actions and intentions etched on one’s soul. A good character comes from fulfilling virtues of nature. The course this is based on doesn’t deeply discuss all of the virtues, but it deals with several of them, including courage, justice, and practical judgement.
		</p> <p>
		Courage (<a href="courage.html">Chapter 6</a>) is having the right disposition towards fear and confidence. Justice (<a href="justice.html">Chapter 7</a>) is righting wrongs and teaching a city how to live righteously. Practical judgement (<a href="judgement.html">Chapter 8</a>) is the art of the statesman, able to politically understand how settings work together and how to influence them.
		</p> <p>
		Deliberation (<a href="deliberation.html">Chapter 5</a>) is how we decide to do things - we decide to behave virtuously and we decide to shape our character. Character is effortful, not passive, and requires us to decide we want to do things.
		</p> <p>
		Friendship (<a href="friendship.html">Chapter 9</a>) is what binds a city together. It’s not justice that holds a group of people in community. It is all kinds of friendship, as there isn’t justice among friends - you’re not “evening the scales” of who has wronged who. For friendship, the more you give the more you receive in turn.
		</p> <p>
		So if happiness is the ultimate goal, which is fulfilling the purpose of living morally and virtuously in community, we need a city that provides a just environment for that to happen. We need people to be courageous and defend that city; we need people to have practical judgement in order to run that city. We need people to be able to deliberate about what to do for the city and personally, and we need people to be able to shape their character through following just laws. All of this provides the ideal environment for contemplation (<a href="contemplation.html">Chapter 10</a>). And that is where the philosopher finds his home.
