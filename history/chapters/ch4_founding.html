	<h1> The American Founding </h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<h3><b> The Setting</b></h3>
		<p>
		The American colonists were under what was known as benign or salutary neglect. The colonial assemblies had the power of the purse, and the governors were thus under the thumb of the colonists’ agendas. The rules regarding the colonies were laxly enforced, as long as the colonists stayed loyal to the British Empire and kept fueling their trade. Whigs in England were mostly fine with the policy of salutary neglect - Edmund Burke, a member of the Old Whig Party in Britain criticized King George III when he enacted heavier taxes. He argued that since the American colonies had produced a great amount of wealth, and it appeared they would continue to do so, the British should simply leave them alone and not interfere. In a famous speech to parliament in 1774 he said:
		</p> <p> <i>
		“Again and again, revert to your old principles — seek peace and ensue it; leave America, if she has taxable matter in her, to tax herself...Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it.... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it.... Do not burthen them with taxes.... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question.... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.”</i>
		</p> <p>
		In 1651 the British enacted something called the Navigation Acts. The primary purpose of these was to restrict the colonies from trading with ships that were not British. This meant the Dutch, the primary mercantile rivals of the British Empire, could no longer trade with the lucrative American colonies for key products such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton in exchange for commodities from Africa or Asia. The colonists, of course, simply began trading illegally instead of legally with the Dutch. However, due to salutary neglect discussed above, these laws were not even particularly enforced until 1764. One of Burke’s propositions in his speeches to parliament was that the laws in place restricting American were enough to continue lining the English pockets. According to him, there was no need to increase taxes as the trade restrictions meant England got a lot of the colonies’ profit anyways. 
		</p> <p>
		The British did not heed his warning and for most of the war Burke was in the minority of the English public opinion. They passed the Townshend Acts, championed by Charles Townshend, which more or less taxed everything far beyond what the colonists were accustomed to. The colonists began boycotting the acts and smuggling out and in anything and everything they could, building tensions up to the Boston Tea Party of 1773 . After 340 chests of tea were dumped into the Boston harbor, the English began passing what became known as the Intolerable Acts (or, in Britain, the Coercive Acts). Over the course of 1774, the four acts were passed:
		</p>
		<p>1) The Boston Port Bill, which closed the Boston Harbor. </p>
		<p>2) The Massachusetts Government Act, which suspended the Massachusetts charter, empowered the British authorities, and changed the system by which the council was chosen to be appointive rather than elective. </p>
		<p>3) The Administration of Justice Act, which protected any British officials charged with capital offenses by ensuring they would go to England for trial, rather than being tried in the colonies. </p>
		<p>4) The new Quartering Act, which gave the British governors the right to demand empty buildings for housing British troops. (This one didn’t quite apply in Massachusetts, as there was some American schemery that prevented this from working out as intended)</p>
		</p> <p>
			The goal of these four acts was to separate Massachusetts from the other colonies and cow it into submission. Instead, it had quite the opposite effect and was used as reasoning for the establishment of the first Continental Congress in September of that year. The Congress declared they were not interested in rebelling - in fact, they were quite loyal to the British crown, but they disputed the Parliament’s right to levy taxes upon them. They passed the Articles of Association, a document that proposed the colonies refuse trade with the British beginning December 1st of 1774 . The Constitution agreed to reconvene May 10, 1775, but by then tensions had certainly escalated. The Revolutionary War had already begun, the first shot being fired on April 19, 1775 on the way to Lexington and Concord.

		<h3><b>Jefferson's Last Letter</b></h3>
		<p> 
			Thomas Jefferson, when he was 83 years old and in poor health, was invited to Washington DC for the 50th anniversary of the signing of the declaration, in the year 1826. He was too sick to come, but he penned a final letter to Roger Weightman, mayor of Washington, and that letter has since become famous. It lays out the purpose of the constitution and the purpose of America.
		</p> <p>
			There were three main points: one, we are all free people. Two, we are justified in our right to rule ourselves. Three, we were not disprudent by overthrowing a longstanding government. Jefferson argues that the founding generation had not thrown off British rule for frivolous reasons, but a long train of abuses showed that it was not only the colonies right, but their duty to do so. They had to organize a new government for the safety of the people, one that was entirely new and assumed all the authorities previously given to the crown. They no longer held powers delegated to them - they now held all the ruling power.
		</p> <p>
			If life, liberty, and happiness could be enjoyed equally in a society without government as one with, government becomes useless. But since a society requires government to oversee the rights of individuals, government is a necessary evil. As a necessary evil, it should be kept to a minimum. You must first give the government the power to control the people, and then the power to control itself. The latter is even more important than the former, as unrestrained government without representation leads directly back into what the colonists just got out of.
		</p> <p>
			Jefferson laid out his case and then died on July 4th, 1826. He passed away hours before John Adams, whose dying words were, “Thomas Jefferson still survives.” Charles Caroll, the only other surviving signature on the Declaration of Independence, passed away a few years later in 1832 at age 95. Thus, the founding generation passed away and passed this long-lasting republic they had created, despite the problems it still had, onto the next generation.
