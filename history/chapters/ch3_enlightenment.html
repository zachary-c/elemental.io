		<h3><b> George Whitefield and Ben Franklin</b></h3>
		<p>George Whitefield was an Englishman, an Anglican priest. He visited every single British county - likely spoke to ten million people of every conceivable sect and religion. His audience had no true defining religion besides religious enthusiasm.
		</p> <p>
		He drew enormous crowds but was rejected by clergy, and his only message was you have to be born again. “God within us” was the entire idea. His preaching stirred up all kinds of schisms in organized religion - Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists all splitting up around what he was saying. There were lots of American ministers embracing his brand of “rational religion.” There was also a boost of religious confidence in England. It was an exciting time. 
		</p> <p>
		Ben Franklin was an American author, inventor, discoverer, printer, ambassador, and a whole host of other things. He became known as the ideal American, founding the College of Philadelphia, organizing a fire department there along with a Pennsylvanian militia, and signing the declaration of independence. He was completely different from Whitefield but the two of them ended up as close friends. Franklin agreed to print and promote Whitefield’s sermons, despite not being a Christian. He believed in virtue for the sake of building a good society, whereas Whitefield promoted them as Christian morals. 
		</p> <p>
		Franklin had 13 cherished virtues (see below), and he kept a pocketbook of them all. What he would do was take each of them and work on it for one week, doing his best to follow and behave virtuously in all possible ways. At the end of each day he would write down any mistakes he had made regarding that virtue and do his best to correct them the next. Once he felt he had a virtue down, he would move onto the next, making sure to keep the first one in check as he did so. Doing so, he would move through all 13 virtues in the course of 13 weeks, presumably becoming closer and closer to being totally virtuous. What he discovered was that he could never attain total virtuosity, but he found it greatly enhanced his quality of life and relationships with other human beings. So at the end of thirteen weeks, he would start back on week one, again attempting to keep all the other virtues in check that he had already gone through.  
		</p> <p>
		Whitefield’s preaching brought the thirteen colonies together - they now had common ideas about religion and how to live in concert. It gave them a common experience on which to build political relationships. At around this time, 1754, Ben Franklin proposed the Albany Plan of Union as a counter to the French-Indian War threat. It pretty much laid out the bare bones of the constitution the Americans ended up with, but neither the colonists nor the British particularly liked the idea. The colonists feared losing their colonial sense of identity as Virginians or Pennsylvanians, and the British believed that it would result in too much centralized power in the colonies, which could lead to a revolt. So it went nowhere.

		<h3><b>Salutary Neglect</b></h3>
		<p> 
			Now, during this period the English crown adopted what became known as Salutary or Benign Neglect. It was the unofficial stance that the American colonies could do more or less whatever the heck they felt like. The basic idea was that if we leave them alone, they’ll cooperate with us however we want. Most of the colonists still felt like British citizens - they were operating under British common law that was enforced by the local assemblies. But, they were practically independent, except for the British governors who were supposed to govern the colonies.
		</p> <p>
			The English governors in charge had a heck of a time. The assemblies were all frequently and repeatedly re-elected colonists, and the colonial assemblies had full control of the salaries. So let’s say that the British governor wants to appoint a judge. The colonists say, “Okay, sounds great, except we’re pretty sure he’s not actually the right guy for the job so we’re not going to pay him anything. We think this guy over here would be a great judge though!”
		</p> <p>
			So the British governor is forced to appoint the judge the colonists want. You might wonder, why don’t they just crack down on them and give control back to the governors? Well, to do that would take quite a bit of reform and the British government is much more concerned with matters and home and later the French and Indian War at the moment. Each of these governors lasted for a relatively short tenure, especially compared to the colonial ruling bodies. Each of these governors would be sent over from Britain with all these instructions about how to properly reform the colonies, but they would soon find that if they tried to do anything the colonists didn’t like the colonists would simply revoke their salaries. Governors got paid quite a lot, so it was in their best interests to appease the colonists and simply get out with all the money. The governors came and went, and the colonies ran the show.
		</p> <p>
			That is, until 1765. The French and Indian War had just ended, and the British were now quite certain that the American colonies should pay off a lot of the debt that Britain had gotten itself into defending them. That was the end of Salutary Neglect, and the beginning of the path to the American Revolution.
