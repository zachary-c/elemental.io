		<p> Courage is a cardinal virtue. It is having the right disposition towards confidence and fear. It stands between rashness and cowardice, which are a excess and deficit of confidence, respectively. The goal in courage is to find an appropriate response to fear - what to do that helps solve the problem but isn’t throwing your life away? 
		</p> <p>
		A courageous act is one that is beautiful and effectively. A good example of this is a helicopter pilot in Vietnam repeatedly landing on rough terrain to save troops that are pinned down. It is effective (the pilot saved them) and it is a beautiful act done for the sake of something worthy - saving human life. Motive is important here - doing it for the sake of something worthy as opposed to doing it without knowledge of the risk involved. If that helicopter pilot, for whatever reason, didn’t realize that there were enemy forces about, he would not be acting courageously - he would just be going about something more normal.
		</p> <p>
		According to Aristotle, one can be brave - acting despite fear - without being courageous. Courage requires practice, and a courageous act is done for the sake of the beautiful (like the helicopter pilot saving his fellow soldiers). Practicing courage takes time and effortful choice.
		</p> <p>
		All of the moral virtues require the right desire and good thought to go with it. Through practical judgement (Ch. 8) we are able to make decisions that are morally correct. Everyone can do this - everyone has the capacity within them to develop Aristotle’s virtues. The right desire and right thought will lead to a good choice, even if it doesn’t work out the best. How to get better at finding the good choice? Practice. (side note: basically Aristotle just says to practice everything and you will get better at it eventually). Since everyone can become virtuous, everyone can become courageous - performing beautiful acts for the sake of that which is worthy.
