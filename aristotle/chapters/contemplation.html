	<h1> Chapter 10: Contemplation and Action </h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<p> 
		Before we can get to contemplation, we have to go through <a href="happ.html">happiness</a> and intellect. First, happiness. Happiness is a being-at-work. This is not an active condition, since that can be somewhat passive. A happy man must actively be doing the activity - the work - of happiness. This is not a 9-5 job “work” but the activity proper to human beings. The soul chooses to be doing this work, because it is what makes us happy.
		</p> <p> 
		Intellect is the part of the soul that understands what things are. Intellectual virtues include knowledge - the accurate identification of lasting things, practical wisdom (<a href="judgement.html">Chapter 8</a>) - the proper grasp of changeable things and circumstances, and wisdom - knowledge of the sources or causes of a particular thing as well as the implications of those causes.  Aristotle or more describing human experience than naming parts of the soul here. The kind of thinking used for understanding things is different from that of decision making, which is different from that of knowing the causes of things.
		</p> <p>
		Contemplation itself is beholding the highest things. We live for beholdings of the beautiful. It is the noblest human activity because intellect, the most perfect thing in us, rests on the divine nature, the most perfect thing that exists. Since God is the most blessed and happy being, and he is divine, then the activity that is most like the divine makes us the happiest. The ideal being would be able to do nothing but contemplate all day - God is the very concept of thought thinking about itself.
		</p> <p>
		Humans are not able to only contemplate all day - they require food and water and community and all these other things. So, since we are not immortal beings who can contemplate and do nothing else, we require moral and mortal virtues to keep us on the correct path. One cannot be a good philosopher if their soul is in turmoil.
		</p> <p>
		Lastly, Aristotle ends the book by pointing to his book on politics. This is because the philosopher cannot exist without a statesman. If contemplation is the highest virtue and perfection, and men need good laws to be able to become virtuous, then the philosopher depends on the statesman to make those good laws and build a safe city for the philosopher to contemplate in.
