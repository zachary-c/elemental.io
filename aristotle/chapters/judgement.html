	<h1> Chapter 8: Practical Judgement </h1>
	<div>
		<hr>
		<p> Moral virtues have to do with the appetitive (desiring) part of the soul, and the intellectual virtues deal with the rational (thinking) part. The two parts, appetitive and rational, work together to achieve things. The appetitive knows what you want and the rational helps you get it. A good soul balances these two parts and they can work together to make things happen. The virtue that achieves this is practical judgement.
		</p> <p>
		Wisdom and practical wisdom are two different things. Wisdom deals with things that donâ€™t change (e.g., the nature of the cosmos) and practical wisdom deals with things that do change. Circumstances are constantly changing and thus practical judgement (or wisdom, or prudence - the terms are interchangeable here) is how one navigates that. 
		</p> <p>
		Prudence is a truth-disclosing active condition that uses reason, governs action, and is concerned with what is good and bad. Truth is the highest form of the good and if a thing is true it can be considered good. Thus, prudence helps us find what is good by finding what is true.
		</p> <p>
		There are two similar ideas to prudence discussed by Aristotle here. They are astuteness and cleverness. Astuteness deals with understanding a situation and cleverness deals with how to insert yourself into, or act upon that situation. Prudence calls upon these two ideas, but it is more than them. They can be used in whatever way, but prudence is directed towards that which is good. Hitler was very clever, but he was not prudent.
		</p> <p>
		Aristotle calls upon another character here, not the philosopher, but the statesman (see <a href="contemplation.html">Chapter 10</a>). A philosopher is more concerned with thinking than everyday life, and thus we need someone to run and guard the city so philosophical pursuits can flourish. To be a statesman requires practical judgement, and with it astuteness and cleverness. The statesman is the guardian of the wise.
