		<h4> School in Assus, 347 BC</h4>		
		<p> Students of Plato set up a school in Assus (Modern Day Turkey) for Hermias, new king in Asia Minor. Aristotle works there for several years, learning about biology and researching for books he will later write. <br> In the meantime, Philip, now king, burns Stagirus to the ground because they annoyed him. Plato dies, and Aristotle marries Pythias. He is 37, and she is likely 18.</p>

		<hr width="1" size="10">


		<h4> Returns to Athens, 335 BC</h4>		
		<p> Aristotle returns to Athens and opens his own school, The Lyceum. Alexander the Great has conquered pretty much the whole world by now and he likes Aristotle, so Aristotle can basically do whatever he wants. <br> At the school, he lectures and researches basically every field. He taught students to think about thinking and what separates humans from animals before they started formal proofs. Aristotle himself researched all kinds of things, and Alexander sent back samples from his conquests to be studied (rocks, animals, plants, etc). Here Aristotle develops the main route of logic - Major Premise, Minor Premise, Conclusion. <br> Much of what he wrote while at the Lyceum was a work in progress, showing that he was always updating and referencing other projects at the same time. </p>
		<hr width="1" size="120">

		<h4> Alexander dies, 323 BC</h4>		
		<p> Athens rebels against the Macedonian empire. Aristotle, as a Macedonian, flees to the island of Euboea to avoid a death sentence.</p>
		<hr width="1" size="10">

		<h4> Aristotle dies, 322 BC</h4>		
		<p> Aristotle dies of a stomach illness near his hometown.</p>
		<hr>

		<p> The Lyceum continued to observe, research and document philosophy and the natural world under Theophrastus until 286 BC, when he himself died. It remained active under various other heads until 86 BC, when the Roman general Sulla destroyed it in his assault on Athens. <br> <br>Aristotle's legacy dominated Western thought until the 17th century. Much of what followed was still based largely on Aristotle's work. Some new discoveries in the Middle Ages and Renaissance period were criticized simply because they were not documented by Aristotle. However, Aristotle's beliefs on Astronomy and some other subjects were eventually proven to be false, breaking the spell of his "ultimate authority." Modern thought eventually surpassed him, but he is often credited as the founder of scientific philosophy. It is certainly true that without Aristotle, humanity would not be where it is today.</p>
