		Aristotle lays out three kinds of friendship - of utility, pleasure, and of virtue.
		</p> <p> 
		Friendship of utility is a friendship that both parties find useful. A transactional friendship, for instance - one person buying something from another. The buyer gets the product, whatever it is, and the seller gets the money. Both parties benefit. But if one party no longer benefits, if for example the buyer didn’t have any more money to buy with, then the friendship would end.
		</p> <p>
		Friendship of pleasure is the friendship of doing things together. If I and a friend enjoy playing chess, and we meet up regularly to play chess, that’s friendship. We enjoy each other’s company because we both enjoy chess. Young people are more prone to this form of friendship, and it’s less of what they do and more of who they are than utility friendships.
		</p> <p>
		Friendship of like virtue is choosing to pursue the good life together. Two friends working together towards a good goal. Two friends who are good and alike in virtue. Our goals are similar, and we pursue this one thing, enhancing our dedication to it through each other and enriching each other’s lives. We pursue the same goal and we pursue it with great dedication. Same goes with virtue. This kind of friendship takes time and is rare. The good of one person is willed by the other for the sake of that person.
		</p> <p>
		In the city’s working, one needs friendship. Justice and just laws are important, but are not enough to build a city. First of all, in building a city or any project, one can’t have full justice. If I count every wrong my business partner does against me or every little place I do more than he does and attempt to fully “balance the scales” we’ll never get anything done. There’s a million little opportunities for resentment. There isn’t justice among friends.
		</p> <p>
		In a marketplace, there’s transactional friendship. In parties and theaters, there’s friendship of pleasure. In clubs, guilds, and groups, there’s friendship of virtue, built up over time. It is long-standing friendships that tie the city together, in love of the common good. This ultimate friendship transcends and incorporates the other kinds of friendship into it, and it is the highest goal we should all strive for in relationships. In justice, you are keeping giving and receiving equal. In friendship, the more you give, the more you receive.
